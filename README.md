Part A — Design / Mockup (20 points)
Screenshots are located in hci quiz screenshots folder

initially the home page had no elements of design pattern that was stated in the guest lecture. To improve the home page I implemented Navigation by highlighting
the page the user is currently on so they can properly tell where they are in the website, Implemented Feedback & Status by having the buttons highlight itself when it is hovered over,
Layout & Structure by making the page scale to mobile and implementing hamburger menu so the navbar elements does not ovelap, Data Presentation by making proper spacing between all
images and texts so the user can easily distinguish every element
